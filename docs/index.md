# notefeed

notefeed is a small inbox for short markdown notes. You post notes to a named feed from scripts over HTTP, or by hand in a web UI, and read them back as RSS. Each note is a plain `.md` file on disk, starting with a small `---` header block.

It exists because dashboards like [Glance](https://github.com/glanceapp/glance) and Dynacat can *read* RSS but have nowhere to *post* to. A backup job, a deploy script or a cron check can drop a note into notefeed, and it shows up on the dashboard a few minutes later.

notefeed is private by default and stores nothing about a person. [Sign-in with a verified sender](self-hosting/sign-in/index.md) is opt-in.

## Hosted or self-hosted

The [hosted service](hosted.md) runs at [notefeed.me](https://notefeed.me): nothing to install, open it and post. To run your own, follow the [Quick start](get-started/quick-start.md).

- **Get started:** [Quick start](get-started/quick-start.md) runs notefeed with Docker Compose; [Concepts](get-started/concepts.md) explains feeds, names and read links; [Compared to other tools](get-started/comparison.md) says when to use notefeed, ntfy or both.
- **Using notefeed:** the [web UI](using/web-ui.md), [posting notes](using/posting.md), [pictures](using/pictures.md), [feeds](using/feeds.md) and how to [read them back](using/read-links.md) in Glance, Dynacat and other readers.
